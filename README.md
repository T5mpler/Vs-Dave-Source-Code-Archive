# Vs Dave Source Code Archive

This is an archive of all the source code for every public Vs Dave & Bambi version (Not including 3.0d, an april fools build).

This includes major updates, minor updates, and patch/hotfix updats. 
The id at the right of the folders are the commit ids from the repository.

> [NOT INCLUDED VERSIONS]
-   3.0d (Aprils Fools 2023 Build. Reason: This was not committed onto the repo. This is owned by Erizur).
-   3.1 (Aprils Fools 2025 Build. Reason: Not technically an official release.)


> [COMPILING]
There won't be tips on how to compile these, this is simply just to exist as an archive.
These updates are over 2-3 years old, and because of that a lot of the libraries needed to compile these versions are really old. Compile if you wish, and at your own time.
