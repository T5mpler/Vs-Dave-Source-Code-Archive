# About

This is an archive of all the source code for every public Vs. Dave & Bambi version.

This includes:
-  Major updates (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc.)
-  Minor updates (0.x),
-  Patch/hotfix updats (Patch = 0.0.x).

The id at the right of the folders are the commit ids from the repository.

# NOT INCLUDED VERSIONS
-   3.0d (Aprils Fools 2023 Build. Reason: This was not committed onto the repo. This is owned by Erizur).
-   3.1 (Aprils Fools 2025 Build. Reason: Not technically an official release.)


# COMPILING NOTE:
-   There won't be tips on how to compile these, this is simply just to exist as an archive.

-   These updates are over 2-3 years old, and because of that a lot of the libraries needed to compile these versions are really old. Compile if you wish, and at your own time.
